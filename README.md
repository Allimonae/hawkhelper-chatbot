# Cuny-Resource-Chatbot

# Goals
Our goals was to create a chatbot made for and by Hunter students. It will give students in-depth accurate information on mental health, food assistance, housing initiatives, and more. 

At the same time, students can see the most recent events Hunter is hosting from financial aid workshops to fun to important deadlines.
